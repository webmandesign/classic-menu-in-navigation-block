Extending WordPress Search block with search results modifier fields.


== Description ==

Extending WordPress Search block with search results modifier fields.

= What problem does it solve? =

❓ _Do you want to narrow search results to a specific post type only?_
❓ _Do you want to narrow search results to a specific category/tag/taxonomy term only?_

**Classic Menu in Navigation Block** plugin provides additional search results modification fields solving these issues!

In _**Search** block_ settings sidebar simply choose which post type should the search form look for. You can also choose a taxonomy and a dropdown with the taxonomy terms will be displayed in the search form on your website front-end to further narrow down the search results.

_(Note that this plugin only alters WordPress **Search** block, not the PHP [`get_search_form()` function](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_search_form/).)_
